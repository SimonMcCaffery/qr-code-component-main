### What I learned

I learned that I have a lot to learn. My basic foundations need some work and I need to more fully understand flexbox.

Good practice for adding simple images and the workflow of working from a style guide. 

I used an online reset which I think may have been a mistake until I more fully understand what it is doing and why.

using css variables while unneccessary for this small project I can see being very useful in other projects


### Continued development

Placing images within flex box.

Text sizing for responsivness.

I think the options as far as structuring and organising css as well.

### Useful resources

- [Modern reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - The reset I used, I may use a more simplified one that I more completley understand in future until returning to this and testing my knowledge
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I tried to avoid video and individual tutorials instead getting used to using MDN docs to try and troubleshoot my own issues.
